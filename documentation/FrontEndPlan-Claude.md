## System Requirements

### Comic Book Specifications
- Maximum 6 scenes per comic book
- Image requirements:
  - Format: PNG only
  - Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 (16:9 ratio)
  - Maximum file size: 5MB per image
  - Color space: RGB
  - Minimum resolution: 72 DPI

### Voice Recording Specifications
- Recording limits:
  - Maximum duration: 60 seconds per recording
  - Minimum recordings: 5
  - Maximum recordings: 10
- Audio quality requirements:
  - Format: WAV
