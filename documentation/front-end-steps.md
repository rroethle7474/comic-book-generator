Phase 4: Comic Book Creation Multi-Step Form
Multi-Step Form Component Setup

Create a component dedicated to comic book creation with multiple steps.
Define the steps (initial version might include):
Step 1: Comic Book Title and Description. The description will be an overview of the story we are attempting to tell.
Step 2: Scene 1 – Image upload and description.
Step 3: Scene 2 to Scene 6 – Repeat similar input (ensure a maximum of 6 scenes).
Step 4: Final review and preview.
Use Angular Reactive Forms for form handling and validation.
Step Transitions & Animations

Implement sliding animations between steps (Angular animations can be used to create smooth transitions).
Ensure that each step is clearly visible and that progress is intuitive.
State Management

Develop a service (or use a simple BehaviorSubject) to manage multi-step form state.
Ensure that user inputs persist if a user navigates between steps.
Backend Integration (API Stub)

Create a Comic Book service that will eventually integrate with your backend endpoints (outlined in BackendAPI.md 
).
For now, simulate API calls to store and retrieve form data.
Validation & Error Handling

Add form validations (e.g., required fields, file type/size for image uploads).
Implement error messaging for user input and file upload failures.
Phase 5: Previous Comic Book Viewer Page
List/Grid View Component

Build a component that displays previously created comic books in a grid or table layout.
Use Angular’s structural directives (like *ngFor) to list comic book cards or table rows.
Data Integration

Implement a service method to fetch comic book data from the backend API.
Handle loading states, error handling, and empty states (no comic books yet).
Navigation to Detail Page

Make each comic book card clickable.
Route to a comic book detail view (even if this page is a stub for now).
Responsive Design

Ensure the grid/table view is responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices.
Phase 6: Train Audio Model Page
Audio Model Form Component

Create a component with a simple form to create/update new voice training models.
Design input fields based on preliminary requirements (e.g., model name, description, file upload for audio snippets).
Service Integration

Set up a Voice Recording/Model Training service that will handle API interactions (referencing endpoints from BackendAPI.md 
).
For now, build form stubs and simulate API responses.
UI Elements for Training Process

Add a button to trigger training.
Include a progress bar or status message area to display training progress (to be integrated once backend logic is available).
Responsive and Accessible Design

Ensure form controls are accessible and styled consistently with the rest of the application.
Phase 7: Integration, Navigation & Polish
Routing Integration

Ensure that Angular Router is set up to navigate between:
Landing Page
Comic Book Creation Form
Previous Comic Book Viewer
Train Audio Model Page
Header and Footer Updates

Finalize the header/hamburger menu and footer links.
Verify consistent navigation across all pages.
User Experience Enhancements

Add loading indicators and error messaging components (can be part of shared components).
Implement subtle animations for page transitions.
Polish UI details with Tailwind CSS adjustments for a modern, cohesive look.
Testing & Refinement

Write unit tests for core components and services.
Conduct cross-browser testing and responsive design reviews.
Gather feedback and iterate on UI/UX improvements.
Additional Considerations
State Management:
Consider using BehaviorSubject or NgRx if the application state becomes complex.

File Uploads:
Develop a reusable file upload component for both comic images and audio snippets (with validations for file size/type as specified in your FrontEndPlan).

Future Enhancements:
Once the backend API and additional details for the multi-step process and audio training are finalized, revisit these tasks to integrate API calls, refine error handling, and add additional features like sharing and exporting.

This detailed task plan should provide a structured approach to building out your front end while aligning with the backend and database plans from your provided documentation 
, 
, and 
. Let me know if you need further elaboration on any specific section!
