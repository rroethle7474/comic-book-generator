# Comic Book Scene Manager Enhancement

## Epic Description
Redesign the comic book scene management workflow to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The new implementation will allow users to manage multiple scenes (1-6) in a grid layout with drag-and-drop capabilities for both image uploads and scene reordering. This enhancement aims to streamline the scene creation process and provide immediate visual feedback to users.

### Key Features
- Grid-based scene management interface
- Drag-and-drop image upload
- Scene reordering capabilities
- Real-time scene preview
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Product Backlog Items (PBIs)
